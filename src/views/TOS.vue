          <p>
            My workdays are Wednesday-Friday (and some Saturdays). I do not work on Sunday-Tuesday.<br><br>
            Commissions are sold as-is when completed. <span>NO REFUNDS</span>!<br><br>
            If you have already given me final approval on completed artwork and
            wish to make a change, I will do so for a fee. I <span>WILL NOT</span> make changes
            for free after the work is complete.<br><br>
            I <span>WILL NOT</span> draw anything that involves scat/poop, vomit, and/or any sexual
            depiction of a minor(cub art).<br><br>
            I REFUSE to draw any feral art in any sexual manner.<br><br>
            I <span>REFUSE</span> to draw anything that discriminates against someones race,
            sexual orientation, and/or gender identity.<br><br>
            You are required to be 18 or older (or of legal age in your state/country), and must
            provide me your legal photo ID to commission me for any sexually explicit and/or NSFW art!<br><br>
            For Sexually Explicit (NSFW) & GORE commissions involving someone elses Original Character(s) (OC) 
            I will need their written permision as well as their proof of legal age (18+).<br><br>
            For artwork that is shipped: I will provide a tracking number (if shipping in the U.S.)
            and provide free shipping for any at-convention artwork that requires it.
            For online commissions, you <span>MUST</span> pay full shipping costs. If art gets lost in
            the mail, you can get your art re-shipped for half of the commission cost.<br><br>
            The only acceptable forms of payment for online commissions are PayPal or KoFi donations.<br><br>
            At-convention acceptable forms of payment is PayPal, Debit/Credit card, and cash in the form of
            USD only.<br><br>
            Please do not spam or harass me with messages about your artwork! If you do, I will refund
            you and refuse any future commissions/requests/trades from you!<br><br>
            Digital artwork may take up to one month to complete, and Traditional artwork up to two weeks.<br><br>
            I will not start on your commission until payment is made in full.<br><br>
            Full refunds will only be made if I have not started your commission.<br><br>
            You <span>MUST</span> credit me as the artist for any art you post on any website or social
            media page!<br><br>
            I will not accept any partial payments for any artwork <span>NO EXCEPTIONS</span>!
            Paid commissions takes priority over art-trades and requests, so they may take longer to complete.<br><br>
            I reserve the right to reject any commission/trade/request that I do not feel comfortable with doing.<br><br>
